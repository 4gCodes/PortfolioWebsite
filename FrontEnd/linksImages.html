    <!-- Links in HTML (<a> Tag)
Links in HTML are created using the <a> (anchor) tag. 
They allow users to navigate between different web pages or resources.
An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element 
we want to be a link with an <a> tag. -->

    <a href="www.youtube.com">click me</a>


    <!-- Types of Links:  and relative links
    Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:
            1: Absolute: Links to pages on other websites on the internet.
            2: relative:Links to pages located on our own website -->

            <!-- Absolute Link -->
            <a href="www.youtube.com">click me</a>

            <!-- Relative link -->
            <a href="lists.html">Go To Lists Page</a>



    <!-- Images in HTML (<img> Tag)
Images in HTML are inserted using the <img> tag. 
They enhance the visual appeal of your web page.
To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. 
Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the <img> element is self-closing. 
Empty, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.  

Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into
the page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located. 
The src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image
using both absolute and relative paths.-->
